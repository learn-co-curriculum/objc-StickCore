# StickCore

## Objective

Learn some basics of Core Graphics so you can read it at a later date! Plus, be happy.

## Instructions

1) Create a stick figure using CoreGraphics methods taught in class. It should have arms, legs, a head, and ideally some hair and a face!

2) Randomize the size of the stick figure.

3) Randomize the color of the stick figure.

4) Rotate it randomly so that each time you load up the view it is at a different rotation. Make sure it is basically upright still though!)

5) Make many overlapping stick figures over your view!

6) Make all stick figures have a shadow. Make sure the shadows do not overlap any of the smiley faces you create. 

## Advanced

1) If Core Graphics excites you...read up on how to create 3-D effects in a 2-D world (Core Graphics is not meant to do this in any advanced way, but can be used to create 3-D effects the same way you might using perspective on paper, e.g. a z-axis.) Then, instead of just sizing your stick figures differently, make them look like they are at different levels in space. This is pretty hard...and will not be reviewed.


2) Read up on gradients in Core Graphics and really give the faces of your stick figures some personality.

## Hints

* Helper methods might be useful to create to save you some time with repetitive tasks!
