# StickCore

## Objective

Learn some basics of Core Graphics and some UIKit convenience methods.

## Instructions

1) Create a stick figure using CoreGraphics methods taught in class. It should have arms, legs, a head, and ideally some hair and a face!

2) Randomize the size of the stick figure.

3) Randomize the color of the stick figure.

4) Rotate it randomly so that each time you load up the view it is at a different rotation. Make sure it is basically upright still though!)

5) Make many overlapping stick figures over your view and add a button to make them refresh all of their random qualities.

6) Make all stick figures have a shadow. Make sure the shadows do not overlap any of the smiley faces you create. 

7) Add gradients to the faces of the stick figures. Make sure the faces still have an outline!

## Advanced

If Core Graphics excites you...read up on how to create 3-D effects in a 2-D world (Core Graphics is not meant to do this in any advanced way, but can be used to create 3-D effects the same way you might using perspective on paper, e.g. a z-axis.) Then, instead of just sizing your stick figures differently, make them look like they are at different levels in a 3-D space. This is quite hard...and will not be reviewed.

## Resources

* Check out this [free book](http://www.apeth.com/iOSBook/index.html) on Objective-C. [Chapter 15](http://www.apeth.com/iOSBook/ch15.html) will be useful. It's a bit old, but for Core Graphics still quite relevant.

* A nice [blog post](http://weblog.invasivecode.com/core-graphics) on Core Graphics.

## Hints

* Helper methods might be useful to create to save you some time with repetitive tasks!

* Don't forget to release references you create yourself!
